NTRODUCTION: 
 
“Online Examination System” focuses on creating effective assessment questions and focusing on exam’s feedback delivery to students. In the paper we present techniques that are pertinent to the elements of assessment process: answers submission, and feedback after submission.
 
As the modern organizations are automated and computers are working as per the instructions, it becomes essential for the coordination of human beings, commodity and computers in a modern organization.
  
The administrator ,faculty, Students who are attending for online examination can communicate with the system through this projects, thus facilitating effective implementation and monitoring of various activities of Online Examinations like conducting Exams as per scheduled basis and delivering result to that particular user or student.And the details of students who attempted Online Examination are maintained at administrator. 
 
PURPOSE
 The purpose of on-line test simulator is to take online test in an efficient manner and no time wasting for checking the paper. 
The main objective of on-line test  is to efficiently evaluate the candidate thoroughly through a fully automated system that not only saves lot of time but also gives fast results. 
For students they give papers according to their convenience and time and there is no need of using extra thing like paper, pen etc. 
SCOPE 
 
Scope of this project is very broad in terms of other manually taking exams.
Few of them are:- 
This can be used in educational institutions as well as in corporate world. 
No restriction that examiner has to be present when the candidate takes the test.

 There are three sub modules in this phase.  

Student module. 
Faculty module. 
Administrator module. 
The functionality of each module is as follows:
Student module: The student  will logon to the software and take his       examination. He can also check his previous examinations marks and his details. The candidate will get result immediately after the completion of the examination.
 Faculty module: The database is prepared & loaded into the software. Selection for examination can be done  by the examiner. The results will be displayed immediately after completion of the examination.
 Administrator module: The administrator collects all the results after successful completion of the examination .
The features that are available to the Administrator are:

The administrator has the full-fledged rights over the OES.

 Can create/delete an account.

Can view the accounts.

Can change the password.

Can hide any kind of features from the both of users.

Insert/delete/edit the information of available on OES.

     The features available to the Students are:

Ø                      Can view the different categories of Test available in their account.

Ø                     Can change password.
